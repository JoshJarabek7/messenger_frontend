## Items To Be Implemented

### For User Implementation (High Priority)

These require adding your actual API keys and implementing core AI functionality:

1. **OpenAI Integration** in `/app/api/embeddings/route.ts`:

   - Add your OpenAI API key to .env.local
   - ✅ Implement text processing utilities for safe embedding generation
   - ✅ Implement the `getEmbedding()` function with the OpenAI client
   - ✅ Replace the mock embedding generation with actual calls to OpenAI's embedding API

2. **AI Response Generation** in `/app/api/ai-response/route.ts`:

   - ✅ Implement text tokenizing, splitting, and summarization for large inputs
   - ✅ Create safe chat function that handles token limits
   - ✅ Implement the OpenAI chat completion functionality with context building
   - ✅ Add context building using the user's AI persona prompt
   - ✅ Implement RAG to fetch relevant message history for context

3. **Vector Search** in `/components/join-organization-form.tsx`:
   - ✅ Create utility functions for embedding generation with token constraints
   - ✅ Create SQL stored procedure for vector search functionality
   - ✅ Implement semantic search functionality using embeddings
   - ✅ Replace the simple text filtering with actual vector search calls

### Next Steps

- Test the implementation with real OpenAI API keys
- Add your OpenAI API key to .env.local to activate the functionality
- Execute the SQL stored procedure on your Supabase instance to enable vector search

### Secondary Enhancements

- [ ] Implement message search functionality using vector embeddings
- [ ] Add typing indicators for better real-time feedback
- [ ] Implement message formatting with markdown support
- [ ] Add read/unread indicators for messages
- [ ] Enhance the notification system for mentions
- [ ] Implement mobile responsiveness for all screens
- [ ] Create simple analytics for message activity
- [ ] Improve AI response quality through prompt engineering

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for API calls
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for OpenAI API calls
- [ ] Add proper loading states for AI operations
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Optimize database queries for larger datasets
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
